<p>Develop a function that consumes two 
<tt>Posn</tt> structures -- one representing the
center of a circle and the other representing a point on its
circumference -- and produces the area of the
disk enclosed by the circle. 
Area of a disk = PI * <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>.</p>

Provide a structure definition and a data definition for a paycheck
with check number, name, date, and amount properties.
<p>
Develop a function to produce a paycheck given
the following information: check number, name, date, hours worked,
wage, and percent tax reported as a decimal. The amount of the check
is calculated by multiplying the hours worked by the wage less any
taxes.

Provide a structure definition and a data definition for a game
score. A game score is characterized by two pieces of information: a
symbol representing the name of the team and a number
representing the points that were scored by that team. 
<p>
Develop a function that consumes two scores from a 
particular game and returns
the name of the team that won or 'Tie if the scores were
equal.

Provide a structure definition and a data definition for an online
auction entry, which is characterized by four pieces of information:
the item number, the highest bidder, the current bid, and 'Open or 'Closed.
<p>
Develop a function that consumes a bidder, a bid amount, and an auction
entry then returns a new entry. If the bid amount is less than the
current bid or if the auction is closed, then the original entry is
returned.

<p>
Provide a structure definition and a data definition for ice cubes
with mass and velocity properties. 
</p>
<p>
Develop a function that produces a
single ice cube from two colliding 
ice cubes with the following assumptions.
</p>
<p>
Simultaneously, two ice cubes are sent towards each other along a horizontal 
track.
Because they are traveling in opposite directions, 
one cube has a positive velocity and the other a negative
one.
Because the cubes are made of ice, you can assume that the friction between
the cubes and the track is zero.
However, the cubes are designed to stick together when they meet, 
resulting in a single cube.
</p>
<p>
Momentum is conserved: meaning that the sum of the momenta
of the original cubes will equal the momentum of the combined cube.
Momentum is computed by multiplying an object's mass by its velocity.

<p>The goal of the exercise is to draw a picture with baloons.</p>

<p>Develop the function <code>pick-color</code>. The function consumes the
numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3. For 0, it produces 'red, for 1 'green, for 2 'blue,
and for 3 'yellow.</p>

<p>Develop the function <code>draw-baloon</code>.  The function consumes
two numbers, between 0 and WIDTH and 0 and HEIGHT, respectively, and a
color symbol ('red, 'green, 'blue, 'yellow). It draws a baloon on a canvas
of size WIDTH x HEIGHT. A baloon consists of a disk, which is described by
RADIUS, and a line, which is described by length. Experiment with different
values for WIDTH, HEIGHT, RADIUS, and LENGTH to find pleasing proportions.
</p>

<p>Develop a function that consumes a symbol and draws a baloon at a random
place and with a random color (one of: 'red, 'green, 'blue, 'yellow). Use
<code>pick-color</code> and <code>draw-baloon</code>.

<br>Note: (random N) computes a random number between 0 and N-1.</p>

accepts four integers between 0 and HEIGHT-20 and draws a bar chart (see
picture below).

<p>The dimensions of the canvas are WIDTH x HEIGHT. The base-line's
y-coordinate is at HEIGHT-20. The width of the bar chart is WIDTH-20. The
bars are centered in the remaining space; each of the bars occupies a
quarter of the remaining space. Hint: define global constants that compute
the fixed parts of the four bars: the x-coordinates of their northwest
corner and their width. Here are the first two:

(define X1 10)
(define X2 (+ X1 BAR-WIDTH))
