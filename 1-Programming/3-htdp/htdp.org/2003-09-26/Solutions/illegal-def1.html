A definition has (in order):
  - an open parenthesis, 
  - the word define,
  - another open parenthesis,
  - at least two variables (maybe more),
  - a close parenthesis
  - an expression, and finally

1: This is a legal definition.
   It matches all of the requirements,
   the variables are f and x and
   the expression is the symbol 'x.
   
2: This is an illegal definition.
   It has a symbol in place of a variable.
   It should be
   
     (define (f x) x)
     
   not
   
     (define (f 'x) x)

3: This definition is legal. 
   It matches all of the requirements.
   The variables are f, x and y. The
   expression is a primitive expression
   whose subexpressions are the symbol 'y
   and another primitive expression.
