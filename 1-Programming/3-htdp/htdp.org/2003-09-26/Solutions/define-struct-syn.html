1. The define-struct:

  (define-struct personnel-record (name salary dob ssn))

is legal, becuase it begins with an open paren,
the word define-struct, has an identifier, another open paren, 
a sequence of names and two close parenthesis.

2. The define-struct:

  (define-struct oops ())
  
is legal, becuase it begins with an open paren,
the word define-struct, has an identifier, another open paren, 
a sequence of names (in this case, zero) and two close parenthesis.


3. The define-struct

  (define-struct child (dob date (- date dob)))
  
is illegal because (- date dob) is not legal as a field name.

4. The define-struct:

  (define-struct (child person) (dob date))
 
is not legal because (child person) is not a legal name
for the structure.

5. The define-struct:

  (define-struct child (parents dob date))
  
is legal, becuase it begins with an open paren,
the word define-struct, has an identifier, another open paren, 
a sequence of names and two close parenthesis.
