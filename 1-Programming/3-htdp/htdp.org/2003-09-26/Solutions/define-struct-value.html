A value is a program that cannot
be simplified by hand-evaluation. That is, if there
are hand-evaluation steps possible, it is not a value. 
If there are no more hand-evaluation steps (and no
errors) it is a value.

1. (make-point 1 2 3) is a value, 
because 1, 2 and 3 are values.
   
2. (make-point (make-point 1 2 3) 4 5) is a value,
because (make-point 1 2 3) is a value (from part 1.) and 
4 and 5 are also values.

3. (make-point (+ 1 2) 3 4) is not a value,
becuase (+ 1 2) is not a value. It has a value,
however: (make-point 3 3 4)

There is an important difference between
having a value and being a value. As above,
values are programs that cannot be 
simplified. But, if a program can be
simplified to a value, then that program
has a value. This seeming subtlty between
"have" and "is" is not something special
to values. For example, I have a hat, but
I am not a hat.
