;Data Definition, Model 1:
#|
A file is a symbol.

A directory (short: dir) is either
   1. empty;
   2. (cons f d) where f is a file and d is a dir; or
   3. (cons d1 d2) where d1 and d2 are dirs.

;; directory template
(define (how-many adir)
  (cond
    [(empty? adir) ...]
    [(symbol? (first adir)) ...(first adir)...
                            ...(how-many (rest adir))...]
    [else ...(how-many (first adir))...
          ...(how-many (rest adir))...]))
|#
;; how-many: dir -&gt; number
;; consumes a directory and produces the
;; number of files in the directory tree
(define (how-many adir)
  (cond
    [(empty? adir)
     0]
    [(symbol? (first adir))
     (+ 1 (how-many (rest adir)))]
    [else (+ (how-many (first adir)) 
             (how-many (rest adir)))]))

;Examples as Tests:
(check-expect (how-many empty) 0)
(check-expect (how-many (list 'read!)) 1)
(check-expect (how-many (list 'part1 'part2 'part3)) 3)
(check-expect (how-many (list (list 'part1 'part2 'part3) 
                              (list (list 'hang 'draw) 
                                    (list 'read!))
                              'read!))
              7)
