1: This sentence is illegal. If an expression begins 
   with a parenthesis and a variable (as this one does)
   there must be at least one more expression before
   the closing parenthesis.
2: This sentence is legal. Since it begins with
   an open parenthesis and a primitive operator,
   it must have at least one more expression and
   a close parenthesis. In this case, it has two
   expressions and a close parenthesis. The first
   expression is a number and the second expression
   is a primitive operator expression. The second
   expression is legal because it begins with a
   paren, has a primitive operation, has another
   expression (the variable x), and has a close
   parenthesis.
3: This sentence is legal. Since it begins an
   open parenthesis and a primtive operation,
   it must continue with some number of expressions,
   but at least one. It has three expressions,
   the numbers 1, 2 and 3.
