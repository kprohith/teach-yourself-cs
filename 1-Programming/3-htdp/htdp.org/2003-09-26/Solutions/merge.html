;Data Definition:
a list-of-numbers is either
  1. empty or
  2. (cons n lon)
  where n is a number and lon is a list-of-numbers

;Contract, Purpose, Header:

(define (merge alon1 alon2) ...)

;Template:
(define (merge alon1 alon2) 
  (cond
    [(and (empty? alon1) (empty? alon2)) 
     ...]
    [(and (empty? alon1) (cons? alon2)) 
     ...(first alon2)...(rest alon2)...]
    [(and (cons? alon1) (empty? alon2))      
     ...(first alon1)...(rest alon1)...]
    [(and (cons? alon1) (cons? alon2)) 
     ...(first alon1)...(first alon2)...

;;merge: 
;;  list-of-numbers list-of-numbers  -&gt;  list-of-numbers
;;consumes two lists of numbers, sorted in ascending order.
;;It produces a single sorted list of numbers that contains 
;;all the numbers on both inputs lists (and nothing else).
;;A number occurs in the output as many times as it occurs 
;;on the two input lists together.

(check-expect 
 (merge empty (list 1 2 3))
 (list 1 2 3))
