<p></p>
<p>
<a name="node_idx_192"></a>In general, a program consists not just of one, but of many definitions.
The <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">area-of-ring</span></code> program, for example, consists of two
definitions: the one for <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">area-of-ring</span></code> and another one for
<code class="scheme"><span class="variable">area-of-disk</span></code>. We refer to both as <small>F</small><small>U</small><small>N</small><small>C</small><small>T</small><small>I</small><small>O</small><small>N</small> <small>D</small><small>E</small><small>F</small><small>I</small><small>N</small><small>I</small><small>T</small><small>I</small><small>O</small><small>N</small>s
<a name="node_idx_194"></a><a name="node_idx_196"></a>and, using mathematical terminology in a loose way, say that the program
is <small>C</small><small>O</small><small>M</small><small>P</small><small>O</small><small>S</small><small>E</small><small>D</small> 
<a name="node_idx_198"></a>of several functions. Because the first one,
<code class="scheme"><span class="variable">area-of-ring</span></code>, is the function we really wish to use, we refer to
it as the <small>M</small><small>A</small><small>I</small><small>N</small> <small>F</small><small>U</small><small>N</small><small>C</small><small>T</small><small>I</small><small>O</small><small>N</small>;
<a name="node_idx_200"></a>the second one, <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">area-of-disk</span></code>, is an <small>A</small><small>U</small><small>X</small><small>I</small><small>L</small><small>I</small><small>A</small><small>R</small><small>Y</small>
<small>F</small><small>U</small><small>N</small><small>C</small><small>T</small><small>I</small><small>O</small><small>N</small>, occasionally also called <small>H</small><small>E</small><small>L</small><small>P</small><small>E</small><small>R</small> <small>F</small><small>U</small><small>N</small><small>C</small><small>T</small><small>I</small><small>O</small><small>N</small>.<a name="node_idx_202"></a><a name="node_idx_204"></a></p>
<p>
The use of auxiliary functions makes the design process manageable and
renders programs readable.  Compare the following two versions of
<code class="scheme"><span class="variable">area-of-ring</span></code>:

The definition on the left composes auxiliary functions. Designing it
helped us break up the original problem into smaller, more easily
solvable problems. Reading it reminds us of our reasoning that the area
is the difference between the area of the full disk and the area of the
hole. In contrast, the definition on the right requires a reader to
reconstruct the idea that the two subexpressions compute the area of two
disks. Furthermore, we would have had to produce the right definition in
one monolithic block, without benefit of dividing the problem-solving
process into smaller steps.<p>
For a small program such as <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">area-of-ring</span></code>, the differences between
the two styles are minor. For large programs, however, using auxiliary
functions is not an option but a necessity.  That is, even if we are asked
to write a single program, we should consider breaking it up into several
small programs and <small>C</small><small>O</small><small>M</small><small>P</small><small>O</small><small>S</small><small>I</small><small>N</small><small>G</small> 
<a name="node_idx_208"></a>them as needed. Although we are not
yet in a position to develop truly large programs, we can still get a
feeling for the idea by developing two versions in parallel. </p>
<p>
The first subsection contrasts the two development styles with an example
from the business domain. It demonstrates how breaking up a program into
several function definitions
<a name="node_idx_210"></a><a name="node_idx_212"></a>can greatly increase our confidence in the
correctness of the overall program. The second subsection introduces the
concept of a variable definition,
<a name="node_idx_214"></a><a name="node_idx_216"></a>which is an additional important
ingredient for the development of programs.  The last subsection proposes
some exercises.</p>

<h2><a href="curriculum-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_node_sec_3.1">3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Composing Functions</a></h2>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
Consider the following problem: 
</p>
<blockquote>
Imagine the owner of a movie theater who has complete freedom in setting
ticket prices. The more he charges, the fewer the people who can afford
tickets. In a recent experiment the owner determined a precise
relationship between the price of a ticket and average attendance. At a
price of $5.00 per ticket, 120 people attend a performance. Decreasing
the price by a dime ($.10) increases attendance by 15. Unfortunately,
the increased attendance also comes at an increased cost. Every
performance costs the owner $180. Each attendee costs another four
cents ($0.04). The owner would like to know the exact relationship
between profit and ticket price so that he can determine the price at
which he can make the highest profit.
</blockquote>
While the task is clear, how to go about it is not. All we can say at
this point is that several quantities depend on each other. <p>
When we are confronted with such a situation, it is best to tease out the
various dependencies one at a time:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><i>Profit</i> 
<a name="node_idx_218"></a>is the difference between revenue and costs. </p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p>The <i>revenue</i> <a name="node_idx_220"></a>is exclusively generated by the sale of
tickets. It is the product of ticket price and number of attendees.</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p>The <i>costs</i> <a name="node_idx_222"></a>consist of two parts: a fixed part ($180) and a
variable part that depends on the number of attendees. </p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p>Finally, the problem statement also specifies how the number of
attendees depends on the ticket price.
</p>
</li></ol><p>
Let's formulate a function for each of these dependencies; after all,
functions compute how quantities depend on each other. </p>
<p>
<a name="node_idx_224"></a><a name="node_idx_226"></a><a name="node_idx_228"></a><a name="node_idx_230"></a>We start with contracts, headers, and purpose statements. Here is the one
for <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">profit</span></code>: 
</p>
<div align="left"><pre class="scheme"><span class="comment">;; <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">profit</span> <span class="selfeval">:</span> <span class="variable">number</span> &nbsp;<tt>-&gt;</tt>&nbsp; <span class="variable">number</span></code></span>

(<span class="keyword">define</span> (<span class="variable">profit</span> <span class="variable">ticket-price</span>) ...)
</pre></div><p>
It depends on the ticket price because both revenue and cost depend on
the ticket price. Here are the remaining three: 
</p>
<div align="left"><pre class="scheme"><span class="comment">;; <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">revenue</span> <span class="selfeval">:</span> <span class="variable">number</span> &nbsp;<tt>-&gt;</tt>&nbsp; <span class="variable">number</span></code></span>

Each purpose statement is a rough transliteration of some part of the
problem statement.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="node_thm_3.1.1"></a>
<b>Exercise 3.1.1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The next step is to make up examples for each of the functions. Determine
how many attendees can afford a show at a ticket price of $3.00, $4.00,
and $5.00. Use the examples to formulate a general rule that shows how to
compute the number of attendees from the ticket price. Make up more
examples if needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../icons/hand.right.gif">

<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="node_thm_3.1.2"></a>
<b>Exercise 3.1.2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Use the results of exercise&nbsp;<a href="#node_thm_3.1.1">3.1.1</a> to determine how much
it costs to run a show at $3.00, $4.00, and $5.00. Also determine how
much revenue each show produces at those prices. Finally, figure out how
much profit the monopolistic movie owner can make with each show. Which is
the best price (of these three) for maximizing the
profit?&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../icons/hand.right.gif">
&nbsp;<a href="../Solutions/movie-examples2.html">Solution</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Once we have written down the basic material about our functions and
calculated out several examples, we can replace the ``<tt>...</tt>'' with
Scheme expressions. The left column of figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_23">5</a> contains
complete definitions of all four functions. The <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">profit</span></code> function
computes its result as the difference between the result of
<code class="scheme"><span class="variable">revenue</span></code> and <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">cost</span></code>, just as the problem analysis and
purpose statement suggest. The computation of both depends on
<code class="scheme"><span class="variable">ticket-price</span></code>, which is what the applications say. To compute the
revenue, we first compute the number of attendees for the given
<code class="scheme"><span class="variable">ticket-price</span></code> and multiply it with
<code class="scheme"><span class="variable">ticket-price</span></code>. Similarly, to compute the cost we add the fixed
portion of the cost to the variable part, which is the product of the
number of attendees and <code class="scheme"><span class="selfeval">0.04</span></code> (four cents). Finally, the
computation of the number of attendees also follows the problem
statement. The base attendance at a price of five dollars is 120, and for
each 10 cents less than five dollars, 15 more attendees show up. </p>

<p>
Instead of developing a function per dependency in the problem statement,
we could have tried to express the relationship between the ticket price
and the owner's profit in a single function. The right column in
figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_23">5</a> shows the most straightforward way of doing so. And
indeed, it is easy to check that the two profit programs in
figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_23">5</a> produce the same profit when given the same ticket
price. Still, it is also obvious that while the arrangement on the left
conveys the intention behind the program directly, the program on the right
is nearly impossible to understand. Worse, if we are asked to modify some
aspect of the program, say, the relationship between the number of
attendees and the price of the ticket, we can do this for the left column
in a small amount of time, but we need to spend a much longer time for the
right one.</p>
<p>
Based on our experience, we thus formulate the first and most important
guideline of programming:

</table>
<p>
Sometimes we will find that some of the required functions are
already available as programs for other problems. Indeed, we have already
encountered such an example: <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">area-of-disk</span></code>.  At other times, we
will make a list of functions and develop each one separately. We may
then find that some of the functions, such as <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">attendees</span></code>, are
useful in several other definitions, leading to a network-like
relationship among functions.</p>

Determine the profit that the movie owner makes at $3.00, $4.00, and
$5.00 using the program definitions in both columns. Make

modified, test them again with ticket prices of $3.00, $4.00, and
$5.00 and compare the results.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../icons/hand.right.gif">

When a number occurs many times in our program(s), we should give it a name
using a <small>V</small><small>A</small><small>R</small><small>I</small><small>A</small><small>B</small><small>L</small><small>E</small> <small>D</small><small>E</small><small>F</small><small>I</small><small>N</small><small>I</small><small>T</small><small>I</small><small>O</small><small>N</small>, which associates a name with a
value. One example is <code class="scheme"><span class="selfeval">3.14</span></code>, which we have used in place of
<img src="curriculum-Z-G-D-1.gif" border="0" alt="[curriculum-Z-G-D-1.gif]">. Here is how we could give this number a name:
</p>
<div align="left"><pre class="scheme">(<span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="variable">PI</span> <span class="selfeval">3.14</span>)
</pre></div><p>
Now, every time we refer to <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">PI</span></code>, DrScheme replaces it with
<code class="scheme"><span class="selfeval">3.14</span></code>. </p>
<p>
Using a name for a constant makes it easier to replace it with a different
value. Suppose our program contains the definition for <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">PI</span></code>, and we
decide that we need a better approximation of <img src="curriculum-Z-G-D-1.gif" border="0" alt="[curriculum-Z-G-D-1.gif]"> for the entire
program. By changing the definition to
</p>
<div align="left"><pre class="scheme">(<span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="variable">PI</span> <span class="selfeval">3.14159</span>)
</pre></div><p>
the improvement is used everywhere where we use <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">PI</span></code>.  If we didn't
have a name like <code class="scheme"><span class="variable">PI</span></code> for <img src="curriculum-Z-G-D-1.gif" border="0" alt="[curriculum-Z-G-D-1.gif]">, we would have to find and all
instances of <code class="scheme"><span class="selfeval">3.14</span></code> in the program and replace them with
<code class="scheme"><span class="selfeval">3.14159</span></code>.</p>

Let us formulate this observation as our second guideline:</p>

</table>
<p>
Initially, we won't use many variable definitions for
constants, because our programs are small. But, as we learn to write
larger programs, we will make more use of variable definitions. As we will
see, the ability to have a single point of control for changes is
important for variable and function definitions.
