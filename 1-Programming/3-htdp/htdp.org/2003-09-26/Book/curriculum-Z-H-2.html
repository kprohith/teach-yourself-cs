Many professions require some form of computer
programming. Accountants program spreadsheets and word processors;
photographers program photo editors; musicians program synthesizers; and
professional programmers instruct plain computers. Programming has become a
required skill.</p>
<p>
Yet programming is more than just a vocational skill. Indeed, <em>good
programming</em> is a fun activity, a creative outlet, and a way to express
abstract ideas in a tangible form. And designing programs teaches a variety
of skills that are important in all kinds of professions: critical reading,
analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail.</p>
<p>
We therefore believe that the study of program design deserves the same
central role in general education as mathematics and English. Or, put more
succinctly,
</p>
<div align="center"><table><tr><td>
 
<strong>everyone should learn how to design programs.</strong>
</td></tr></table></div>

On one hand, program design teaches the same analytical skills as
mathematics. But, unlike mathematics, working with programs is an active
approach to learning. Interacting with software provides immediate feedback
and thus leads to exploration, experimentation, and
self-evaluation. Furthermore, designing programs produces useful and fun
things, which vastly increases the sense of accomplishment when compared to
drill exercises in mathematics. On the other hand, program design teaches
the same analytical reading and writing skills as English.  Even the
smallest programming tasks are formulated as word problems. Without
critical reading skills, a student cannot design programs that match the
specification. Conversely, good program design methods force a student to
articulate thoughts about programs in proper English.<p>

<p>
This book is the first book on programming as the core subject of a liberal
arts education. Its main focus is <em>the design process</em> that leads
from problem statements to well-organized solutions; it deemphasizes the
study of programming language details, algorithmic minutiae, and specific
application domains.  Our desire to focus on the design process requires
two radical innovations for introductory courses.  The first innovation is
a set of <em>explicit design guidelines</em>. Existing curricula tend to
provide vague and ill-defined suggestions, such as ``design from top to
bottom'' or ``make the program structural.'' We have instead developed
design guidelines that lead students from a problem statement to a
computational solution in step-by-step fashion with well-defined
intermediate products. In the process they learn to read, to analyze, to
organize, to experiment, to think in a systematic manner.  The second
innovation is a radically new programming environment.  In the past, texts
on programming ignored the role of the programming environment in the
learning process; they simply assumed that students had access to a
professional environment. This book provides a <em>programming environment
for beginners</em>. It also grows with the students as they master more and
more of the material until it supports a full-fledged language for the
whole spectrum of programming tasks: large-scale programming as well as
scripting.</p>
<p>
<a name="node_idx_2"></a>Our guidelines are formulated as a number of <em>program design
recipes</em>.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_4"></a><a href="#footnote_Temp_4"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> A
design recipe guides a beginning programmer through the entire
problem-solving process. With design recipes, a beginner almost never again
stares at a blank piece of paper or a blank computer screen. Instead, the
student will check the design recipe and use the question-and-answer
guidelines to make some progress.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
We created the design recipes by identifying categories of problems. The
identification of a problem category is based on the classes of data that
are used to represent the relevant information. Starting from the structure
of this class description students derive the programs with a checklist.
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_3">1</a> shows the basic six steps of a design
recipe checklist. Each step produces a well-defined intermediate product:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the description of the class of problem data; 
</p>
<li><p>the informal specification of a program's behavior; 
</p>
<li><p>the illustration of the behavior with examples; 
</p>
<li><p>the development of a program template or layout; 
</p>
<li><p>the transformation of the template into a complete definition; and 
</p>
<li><p>the discovery of errors through testing. 
</p>
</li></ol><p>
The major difference concerns the relationship of steps&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;4.</p>
<p>
Design recipes help beginners and teachers alike. Teachers can use the
recipes to inspect a beginner's problem-solving skills, to diagnose
weaknesses, and to suggest specific remedial steps. After all, each stage
of the design recipe yields a well-defined, checkable product.  If a
beginner is stuck, a teacher can inspect the intermediate products and
determine what the problem is. Based on this analysis, the teacher can then
provide guidance for a specific step in the recipe, raise appropriate
questions, and recommend additional practice exercises.

<p>
Our claim that everyone programs or should learn to program might
appear strange considering that, at first glance, fewer and fewer people
seem to program these days. Instead, the majority of people use application
packages, which don't seem to require any programming.  Even programmers
use ``program generators,'' packages that create programs from, say,
business rules. So why should anyone learn to program?</p>
<p>
The answer consists of two parts. First, it is indeed true that <em>traditional forms of programming</em> are useful for just a few people. But,
programming <em>as we the authors understand it</em> is useful for everyone:
the administrative secretary who uses spreadsheets as well as the high-tech
programmer. In other words, we have a broader notion of programming in mind
than the traditional one. We explain our notion in a moment. Second, we
teach our idea of programming with a technology that is based on the
principle of minimal intrusion. Hence our notion of programming teaches
problem-analysis and problem-solving skills <em>without</em> imposing the
overhead of traditional programming notations and tools.</p>
<p>
To get a better understanding of modern programming, take a closer look at
spreadsheets, one of today's popular application packages. A user enters
formulas into a spreadsheet. The formulas describe how a cell <em>A</em> depends
on another cell <em>B</em>. Then, as the user enters a number into <em>B</em>, the
spreadsheet automatically calculates the contents of cell <em>A</em>.  For
complicated spreadsheets, a cell may depend on many other cells, not just
one.</p>
<p>
Other application packages require similar activities. Consider word
processors and style sheets. A style sheet specifies how to create a (part
of a) document from yet-to-be-determined words or sentences. When someone
provides specific words and a style sheet, the word processor creates the
document by replacing names in the style sheet with specific
words. Similarly, someone who conducts a Web search may wish to specify
what words to look for, what words should be next to each other, and what
words should not occur in the page. In this case, the output depends on the
search engine's cache of Web pages and the user's search expression.</p>
<p>
Finally, using a program generator in many ways relies on the same skills
as those necessary for application packages. A program generator creates a
program in a traditional programming language, such as C++ or Java, from
high-level descriptions, such as business rules or scientific laws. Such
rules typically relate quantities, sales, and inventory records and thus
specify computations. The other parts of the program, especially how it
interacts with a user and how it stores data in the computer's disk,
are generated with little or no human intervention. </p>
<p>
All of these activities instruct some computer software to do something for
us. Some use scientific notation, some may use stylized English, some use a
concrete programming notation. All of them are some form of programming. 
The essence of these activities boils down to two concepts: 
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>relating one quantity to another quantity, and </p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p>evaluating a relationship by substituting values for names. 
</p>
</li></ol><p>
Indeed, the two concepts characterize programming at the lowest level, the
computer's native language, and in a modern fashionable language such as
Java. A program relates its inputs to outputs; and, when a program is used
for specific inputs, the evaluation substitutes concrete values for names.</p>
<p>
No one can predict what kind of application packages will exist five or ten
years from now. But application packages will continue to require some form
of programming. To prepare students for these kinds of programming
activities, schools can either force them to study algebra, which is the
mathematical foundation of programming, or expose them to some form of
programming. Using modern programming languages and environments, schools
can do the latter, they can do it effectively, and they can make algebra
fun.</p>

Learning to design programs is like learning to play soccer.  A
player must learn to trap a ball, to dribble with a ball, to pass, and to
shoot a ball. Once the player knows those basic skills, the next goals are
to learn to play a position, to play certain strategies, to choose among
feasible strategies, and, on occasion, to create variations of a strategy
because none of the existing strategies fits.</p>
<p>
A programmer is also very much like an architect, a composer, or a writer.
They are creative people who start with ideas in their heads and blank
pieces of paper. They conceive of an idea, form a mental outline, and
refine it on paper until their writings reflect their mental image as much
as possible. As they bring their ideas to paper, they employ basic
drawing, writing, and instrumental skills to express certain style
elements of a building, to describe a person's character, or to formulate
portions of a melody. They can practice their trade because they have
honed their basic skills for a long time and can use them on an
instinctive level.</p>
<p>
Programmers also form outlines, translate them into first designs, and
iteratively refine
<a name="node_idx_6"></a>them until they truly match the initial idea. Indeed, the best programmers
edit and rewrite their programs many times until they meet certain
aesthetic standards. And just like soccer players, architects, composers,
or writers, programmers must practice the basic skills of their trade for
a long time before they can be truly creative.</p>
<p>
Design recipes are the equivalent of soccer ball handling techniques,
writing techniques, techniques of arrangements, and drawing skills.  A
single design recipe represents a point of the program design space. We
have studied this space and have identified many important categories.
This book selects the most fundamental and the most practical recipes and
presents them in increasing order of difficulty.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_7"></a><a href="#footnote_Temp_7"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a></p>
<p>
About half the design recipes focus on the connection between input data
and programs. More specifically, they show how the template of a program
is derived from the description of the input data. We call this <em>data-driven</em> program design, and it is the most frequently used form of
design. Data-driven designs are easy to create, easy to understand, and
easy to extend and modify. Other design recipes introduce the notion of
<em>generative recursion</em>, <em>accumulation</em>, and <em>history
sensitivity</em>. The first one produces recursive programs that generate
new instances of problems as they recur; accumulator-style programs
collect data as they process inputs; and history-sensitive programs
remember information between successive applications. Last, but not least,
we also introduce a design recipe for <em>abstracting</em> over
programs. Abstracting is the act of generalizing two (or more) similar
designs into one and of deriving the original instances from it.</p>
<p>
On many occasions, a problem naturally suggests one design recipe.  On
others, a programmer must choose from among several possibilities; each
choice may produce programs with vastly different organizations.  Making
choices is natural for a creative programmer. But, unless a programmer is
thoroughly familiar with the bag of design recipes to choose from and
completely understands the consequences of choosing one over the other,
the process is necessarily <em>ad hoc</em> and leads to whimsical, bad
designs. We hope that by mapping out a collection of design recipes, we
can help programmers understand what to choose from and how to choose.</p>
<p>
Now that we have explained what we mean by ``programming'' and ``program
design,'' the reader can see why and how teaching program design instills 
thinking skills that are important in a variety of professions. To design a
program properly, a student must:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>analyze a problem statement, typically stated as a word problem; 
</p>
<li><p>express its essence, abstractly and with examples; 
</p>
<li><p>formulate statements and comments in a precise language;
</p>
<li><p>evaluate and revise these activities in light of checks and tests;  and 
</p>
<li><p>pay attention to details. 
</p>
</li></ol><p>
All of these are activities that are useful for a businessman, a lawyer, a
journalist, a scientist, an engineer, and many others.</p>
<p>
While traditional programming requires these skills, too, beginners often
don't understand this connection. The problem is that traditional
programming languages and traditional forms of programming force students
to perform a large amount of book-keeping work and to memorize a large
number of language-specific facts.  In short, <em>menial work drowns the
teaching of essential skills</em>.  To avoid this problem, teachers must use
a programming environment that imposes as little overhead as possible and
that accommodates beginners. Because such tools didn't exist when we
started, we developed them. </p>

<h2><a href="curriculum-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_node_sec_Temp_8">The Choice of Scheme and DrScheme</a></h2>

</p>
<p></p>
<div align="right"><table width="60%"><tr><td>
<span class="epigraph">

<p></p>
<div align="left">
<em>We ascribe beauty to that which is simple,<br>
which has no superfluous parts;<br>
which exactly answers its end,<br>
which stands related to all things,<br>

<p></p>
<p>
We have chosen Scheme as the programming language for this book,
and we have designed and implemented DrScheme, a programming environment
for the language with special assistance for beginning students. The
programming environment is freely available at the book's official Web
site.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_9"></a><a href="#footnote_Temp_9"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a></p>
<p>
Still, the book it is not about programming in Scheme. We only use a small
number of Scheme constructs in this book. Specifically, we use six
constructs (function definition and application, conditional expressions,
structure definition, local definitions, and assignments) plus a dozen
or so basic functions. This tiny subset of the language is all that is
needed to teach the principles of computing and programming. Someone who
wishes to use Scheme as a tool will need to read additional material.</p>
<p>
The choice of Scheme for beginners is natural. First, the core of Scheme
permits programmers to focus on just those two elements of programming
that we pointed out at the beginning of the preface: programs as relations
between quantities and evaluating programs for specific inputs.  Using
just this core language, students can develop complete programs <em>during the first session</em> with a teacher.</p>
<p>
<a name="node_idx_20"></a>Second, Scheme can easily be arranged as a tower of language levels. This
property is crucial for beginners who make simple notational mistakes that
generate obscure error messages about advanced features of a language. The
result is often a wasteful search and a feeling of frustration on the
student's part. To avoid this problem, our programming environment,
DrScheme, implements several carefully chosen sublanguages of
Scheme. Based on this arrangement, the environment can signal error
messages that are appropriate to a student's level of knowledge. Better
still, the layering of languages prevents many basic mistakes. We
developed the layers and the protection modes by observing beginners for
weeks in Rice's computer lab. As students learn more about programming and the
language, the teacher can expose students to richer layers of the language,
which allows students to write more interesting and more concise programs.</p>
<p>
Third, the DrScheme programming environment offers a truly interactive
evaluator. It consists of two windows: a <tt>Definitions</tt>
<a name="node_idx_22"></a>window,
where students define programs, and an <tt>Interactions</tt>
<a name="node_idx_24"></a>window, which
acts like a pocket calculator.  Students can enter expressions into the
latter, and DrScheme determines their values. In other words, computation
starts with pocket-calculator arithmetic, which they know quite well, and
quickly proceeds from there to calculations with structures, lists, and
trees -- the kinds of data that computer programs really manipulate. 
Furthermore, an interactive mode of evaluation encourages students to
experiment in all kinds of ways and thus stimulates their curiosity.</p>
<p>
Finally, the use of an interactive evaluator with a rich data language
permits students to focus on problem solving and program design
activities. The key improvement is that interactive evaluation renders a
discussion of input and output operations (almost) superfluous. This has
several consequences.  First, input and output operations require
memorization. Learning these things is tedious and boring. Conversely,
students are better off learning problem-solving skills and using canned
input and output support. Second, <em>good</em> text-oriented input
requires deep programming skills, which are best acquired in a course on
computational problem-solving.  Teaching bad text-oriented input is a
waste of the teachers' and the students' time.  Third, modern software
employs graphical user interfaces (GUI), which programmers design with
editors and ``wizards'' but not by hand. Again, students are best off
learning to design the functions that are connected to rulers, buttons,
text fields and so on, rather than memorizing the specific protocols that
currently fashionable GUI libraries impose. In short, discussing input and
output is a waste of valuable learning time during a first introduction to
programming.  If students decide to pursue programming in more depth,
acquiring the necessary (Scheme) knowledge about input and output
procedures is straightforward.</p>
<p>
In summary, students can learn the core of Scheme in a couple of hours, yet
the language is as powerful as a conventional programming language. As a
result, students can focus immediately on the essence of programming,
which greatly enhances their general problem-solving skills.</p>

<h2><a href="curriculum-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_node_sec_Temp_10">The Parts of the Book</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
The book consists of eight parts and seven intermezzos. The parts focus on
program design; the intermezzos introduce other topics concerning
programming and computing. Figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_11">2</a> shows the
dependence graph for the pieces of the book. The graph demonstrates that
there are several paths through the book and that a partial coverage of
the material is feasible. </p>
<p>
Parts&nbsp;<a href="curriculum-Z-H-3.html#node_part_I">I</a> through&nbsp;<a href="curriculum-Z-H-18.html#node_part_III">III</a> cover the foundations of
data-driven program design. Part&nbsp;<a href="curriculum-Z-H-24.html#node_part_IV">IV</a> introduces
abstraction in designs.  Parts&nbsp;<a href="curriculum-Z-H-31.html#node_part_V">V</a> and&nbsp;<a href="curriculum-Z-H-37.html#node_part_VI">VI</a>
are about generative recursion and accumulation.  For these first six
parts, the book uses a completely functional -- or algebraic -- form of
programming. One and the same expression always evaluates to the same
result, no matter how often we evaluate it. This property makes it easy to
design, and to reason about, programs. To cope with interfaces between
programs and the rest of the world, however, we enrich the language with
assignment statements and abandon some of our algebraic reasoning. The
last two parts show what this means for the design of programs. More
precisely, they show how the design recipes
<a name="node_idx_26"></a>of the first six parts apply and why we must be much more careful once
assignments are added.</p>
<p>
Intermezzos introduce topics that are important for computing and
programming in general but not for program design per se. Some
introduce the syntax and semantics of our chosen subsets of Scheme on a
rigorous basis, a few introduce additional programming constructs.
Intermezzo&nbsp;5 is a discussion of the abstract cost of computing (time,
space, energy) and introduces vectors. Intermezzo&nbsp;6 contrasts two ways of
representing numbers and processing them. </p>
<p>
The coverage of some intermezzos can be delayed until a specific need
arises. This is especially true of the intermezzos on Scheme's syntax and
semantics. But, considering the central role of intermezzo&nbsp;3 in
figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_11">2</a>, it should be covered in a timely fashion.</p>

design is particularly interesting and important for large projects. The
step from small single-function problems to small multifunction projects
requires an additional design idea: iterative refinement.
<a name="node_idx_28"></a>The goal is to
design the core of a program and to add functionality to this core until
the entire set of requirements is met.</p>
<p>
Students in a first course can, and must, get their first taste of
iterative refinement. Hence, in order to acquaint students with the
technique, we have included extended exercises. Typically, a brief
overview sets the stage for a collection of exercises. The exercises
gently guide students through some design iterations. In
section&nbsp;<a href="curriculum-Z-H-21.html#node_chap_16">16</a>, the idea is spelled out explicitly.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the book revisits certain exercise and example topics time

<a href="curriculum-Z-H-10.html#node_sec_7.4">7.4</a>, <a href="curriculum-Z-H-14.html#node_sec_10.3">10.3</a>, <a href="curriculum-Z-H-27.html#node_sec_21.4">21.4</a>,
<a href="curriculum-Z-H-51.html#node_sec_41.4">41.4</a>, and a few exercises in between the last two sections
cover the idea of moving pictures across a canvas.  The students thus see
the same problem several times, each time with more and more knowledge
about how to organize programs.  </p>
<p>
Adding pieces of functionality to a program demonstrates why programmers
must follow a design discipline.  Solving the problem again shows students
how to choose from alternative design recipes.
<a name="node_idx_30"></a>Finally, on occasion, new knowledge just helps students
improve the program organization; in other words, students learn that
programs aren't finished after they work for the first time but that, like
papers and books, they need editing.</p>

T<small>E</small><small>A</small><small>C</small><small>H</small><small>P</small><small>A</small><small>C</small><small>K</small><small>S</small>: A second aspect of working on projects is that
programmers have to work in teams. In an instructional context, this means
that one student's program has to fit precisely to someone else's.  To
simulate what ``fitting one's function to someone else's'' means, we provide
DrScheme teachpacks. Roughly speaking, a teachpack simulates a team
partner yet avoids the frustration of working with mistakes in a partner's
program component.  More technically, the projects almost always consist
of a view and a model program component (in the sense of the
model-view software architecture). In a typical setting, students design
the model component.  The teachpacks provide the view components, often in
the form of (graphical) user interfaces. Thus they eliminate the tedious,
mindless portions of coding. Furthermore, this particular separation of
concerns mimics that of real-world projects. </p>
<p>
Fitting model components to view components requires students to pay
attention to precise specifications of functions. It demonstrates the
paramount importance of following a design discipline. It is also a
critical skill for programmers and is often underemphasized in beginning
courses. In part&nbsp;<a href="curriculum-Z-H-24.html#node_part_IV">IV</a> we show how to construct some simple
GUIs and how GUI events trigger the application of model functions.  The
goal is to explain that constructing GUIs is no mystery, but not to spend
a lot of time on a topic that requires mostly rote learning and little
computational thinking.</p>

S<small>C</small><small>H</small><small>E</small><small>D</small><small>U</small><small>L</small><small>E</small>: Each university, college, and school has its own needs and
must find an appropriate schedule. At Rice University, we conventionally
cover the entire book plus some additional material in a single
semester. An instructor at a research university should probably keep up a
similar pace. A high school teacher will necessarily pursue a slower pace.
Many of the high schools that tested the book covered the first three
parts in a semester; some used only the first part to teach algebraic
problem solving from a computational perspective; and yet others worked
through the entire book in a year. For more information on schedules,
visit the book's Web site. </p>

typeset using a small number of fonts. <i>Italic</i> words refer to
program names and variables.  Sans Serif items are constants and
built-in operations. <strong>Boldface</strong> words are Scheme keywords.</p>
<p>
Definitions come in three varieties. There are those terms that concern the
principles of programming and computing. The book lists the first
occurrence of such terms with <small>S</small><small>M</small><small>A</small><small>L</small><small>L</small> <small>C</small><small>A</small><small>P</small><small>I</small><small>T</small><small>A</small><small>L</small> <small>L</small><small>E</small><small>T</small><small>T</small><small>E</small><small>R</small><small>S</small>. Other
definitions are of a more fleeting nature; they introduce terms that are
important for a section, an example, an exercise, or some other small part
of the book. The book uses <i>slanted</i> words to emphasize such
definitions. Finally, the book also defines classes of data. Most data
definitions are boxed, and the first occurrence of the defined name is also
typeset using <i>slanted</i> words.</p>

<h2><a href="curriculum-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_node_sec_Temp_12">Acknowledgments</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
Four people deserve special thanks: Robert ``Corky'' Cartwright,
who co-developed a predecessor of Rice's introductory course with the first
author; Daniel P. Friedman, for asking the first author to rewrite <em>The Little LISPer</em> (also MIT Press) in 1984, because it started this
project; John Clements, who designed, implemented, and maintains DrScheme's
stepper; and Paul Steckler, who faithfully supported the team with
contributions to our suite of programming tools.</p>
<p>
The development of the book benefited from many other friends and
colleagues who used it in their courses and/or gave detailed comments on
early drafts. We are grateful to them for their help and their patience:
Ian Barland,
John Clements, 
Bruce Duba,
Mike Ernst,
Kathi Fisler,
Daniel P. Friedman,
John Greiner,
John Stone,
Geraldine Morin, 
and
Valdemar Tamez.</p>
<p>
A dozen generations of <em>Comp 210</em> students at Rice University used
early drafts of the text and contributed improvements in various
ways.  In addition, numerous attendees of our TeachScheme! workshops used early
drafts in their classrooms. Many sent in comments and
suggestions. As representative of these we mention the following active
contributors:
Ms. Barbara Adler,
Dr. Stephen Bloch,
Mr. Jack Clay,
Dr. Richard Clemens,
Mr. Kyle Gillette,
Ms. Karen Buras,
Mr. Marvin Hernandez,
Mr. Michael Hunt,
Ms. Karen North,
Mr. Jamie Raymond,
and
Mr. Robert Reid.
Christopher Felleisen patiently worked through the first few parts of
the book with his father and provided direct insight into the views of a
young student. 
Hrvoje Blazevic (sailing, at the time, as Master of the LPG/C Harriette), 
Joe Zachary (University of
Utah) and Daniel P. Friedman (Indiana University) discovered numerous
typos in the first printing, which we have now fixed. 
Thank you to everyone. </p>
<p>

Finally, Matthias expresses his gratitude to Helga for her many years of
patience and for creating a home for an absent-minded husband and
father. Robby is grateful to Hsing-Huei Huang for her support and
encouragement; without her, he would not have gotten anything
done. Matthew thanks Wen Yuan for her constant support and enduring music.
Shriram is indebted to Kathi Fisler for support, patience and puns, and for
her participation in this project.</p>
