Develop a function that computes the distance a boat travels
across a river, given the width of the river, the boat's
speed perpendicular to the river, and the river's speed.
Speed is distance/time, and the Pythagorean theorem is
c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>.

Develop a function that computes 
how long after their deparature two trains will meet.
Assume that the trains travel between two points, 
along a single section of track, going in opposite directions.
The function should consume the trains' speeds and the starting
distance between the trains. Speed is distance/time.

Develop a function that when given an initial amount of
money (called the principal),
a simple annual interest rate, and a number of months will
compute the balance at the end of that time.
Assume that no additional deposits or withdrawals are made and and 
that a month is 1/12 of a year.
Total interest is the product of the principal, 
the annual interest rate expressed as a decimal, 
and the number of years.

The function produces the total length in inches.

<em>contributed by Professor Stephen Bloch, Adelphi University</em>
<p>
The nation of Progressiva has a simple tax code.  The tax you pay
is your salary times the tax rate, and the tax rate is 1/2% per
thousand dollars of salary.  For example, if you make $40,000, your
tax rate is 1/2% times 40, which is 20%, so you pay 20% of $40,000,
which is $8,000.

<p>
Develop a function to compute the net pay (i.e. pay after taxes)
of a person with a given salary.  HINT: develop one or two auxiliary
functions as well as <code>net-pay</code>.
</p>
<p>
This tax system has the peculiar feature that, beyond a certain
income level, it doesn't pay to earn any more: for every additional
dollar you earn, you have to pay MORE than a dollar more to the
government.  Use your net-pay function to find this income level.
</p>

[Note to teachers: this question can be solved easily using
differential calculus, but encourage students to find the answer by
experiment, even if they've studied differential calculus.]

students who have difficulties with their work habits. It progressively
walks them through the very basic design recipe.</p>
