Develop the function <em>within?</em>,
which consumes three numbers representing 
the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
coordinates of a point and the radius 
<em>r</em> of a circle centered around the origin
It returns <code>true</code>
if the point is within or on the circle.
It returns 
<code>false</code> otherwise.
The distance of the point to the origin is 
the square root of <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>.

A local discount store has a policy of putting labels with dates on
all of its new merchandise.
If an item has not sold within two weeks
the store discounts the item by 25% for the third week, 50% for the
fourth week, and 75% for the fifth week. 
After that no additional
discounts are given.
<p>
Develop the function <em>new-price</em>,
which takes the initial price of
an item and the number of weeks since the item was dated and produces
the selling price of the item.

A manufacturing company measured the productivity of its workers and
found that between the hours of 6am and 10am they could produce 30
pieces/hour/worker; 
between 10am and 2pm they could produce 40 pieces/hour/worker; 
and between 2pm and 6pm they could produce 35 pieces/hour/worker.
<p>
Develop a function that takes an hour of the day
between 6am and 6pm, in twenty-four hour format, along with 
the number of workers and computes the
total number of pieces produced during that hour.

An Internet service provider charges a base rate per megabyte (MB)
transferred depending on market conditions.
In addition to the base,
transfers between 100 and 500 MB are charged an additional $0.05/MB
plus 33% of the base.
Data transfers between 500 MB and 1500 MB are
charged 1.44 times the base plus $0.08/MB.
Above 1500 MB the rate is simply twice the base.
All data in a transfer is charged the same rate.
For example, if 1600 MB are transfered, then the charge
for all 1600 MB is twice the base.
<p>
Develop the function <em>bill-amount</em>,
which takes an amount of
data transferred in megabytes and a base rate in dollars 
and computes the total charge.

Develop a function to calculate total tax liability for ANY given
income. 
Assume that the share of income $35,000 and below is federally taxed at
15%, the share of income between $35,000 and $100,000 is taxed at 25%, 
and the share of income over $100,000 is taxed at 35%.
Assume that there is no state income
tax for income up to $50,000 but is a flat 5% for all income above
$50,000.
