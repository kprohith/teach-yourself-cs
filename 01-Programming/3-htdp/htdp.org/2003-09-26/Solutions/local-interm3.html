;; DATA DEFINITIONS
;;
;; &gt; family-tree-node (ftn)
;;   An ftn is either

;;
;; &gt; direction
;;   A direction is either
;;      the symbol 'father or
;;      the symbol 'mother.
;;
;; &gt; path
;;   A path is either
;;      empty or
;;     (cons s los)
;;   where s is a direction and los is a path.

;; TEMPLATE: ftn
