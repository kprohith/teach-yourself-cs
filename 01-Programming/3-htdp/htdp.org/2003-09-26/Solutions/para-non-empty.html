;; Exercise 19.2.4. 

;; Draft. a (non-empty-listof number) is either
;; 1. (cons s empty), or
;; 2. (cons s l) where l is a (non-empty-listof number)
;; and s is always a number.

;; last-number: non-empty-ls -&gt; number
;; consumes a non-empty list of numbers and produces its last number

(check-expect (last-number (list 1 2 3 4 5)) 5)
(check-expect (last (list (list 1) (list 2) (list 3))) (list 3))

(define (last-number non-empty-ls)
  (cond
    [(empty? (rest non-empty-ls)) (first non-empty-ls)]
    [else (last-number (rest non-empty-ls))]))

;; Generalizing to ITEM.

;; a (non-empty-listof ITEM) is either
;; 1. (cons s empty), or
;; 2. (cons s l) where l is a (non-empty-listof ITEM)
;; and s is always an ITEM.

;; last: (non-empty-listof ITEM) -&gt; ITEM
;; consumes a non-empty list of ITEMs and produces its last ITEM

(check-expect (last '(a b c d e f)) 'f)

(define (last non-empty-ls)
  (cond
    [(empty? (rest non-empty-ls)) (first non-empty-ls)]
    [else (last (rest non-empty-ls))]))

;; INSIGHT: in this case, the data-specific function and the 
;; data-parametric one are identical because the former does 
;; not exploit the knowledge about the nature of the list items.
