<pre>#| neighbors: node graph -&gt; (listof node)
   (define (neighbors a-node a-graph) ...)

   Purpose: compute a-node's neighbors in a-graph

   Example:
     in figure~xyz,
       G has no neighbors: empty
       A has the list of neighbors (list 'B 'E)
|#
(define (neighbors a-node a-graph)
  (cond
    ((empty? a-graph) (error 'neighbors "can't happen"))
    (else (cond
	    ((eq? (first (first a-graph)) a-node)
	     (second (first a-graph)))
	    (else (neighbors a-node (rest a-graph)))))))

;; equivalently, with Scheme's built-in lookup function:
(define (neighbors a-node a-graph)
  (second (assq a-node a-graph)))
