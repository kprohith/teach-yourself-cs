Scheme gives an error for the function ;;               call and not yet for the illegal use of sin function.;;2. then, type this in Interactions window: (somef 10);;error message: sin: expects 1 argument, given 2: 10 10;;meaning:       similar error but this time the sin function has ;;               too many arguments in the function definition ;;               for somef.
