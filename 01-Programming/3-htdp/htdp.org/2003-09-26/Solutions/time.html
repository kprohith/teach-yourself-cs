 | <a href="contents.html">Table of Contents</a>
 | <a href="circ-descr.html">6.6.1</a><pre>;; A time is:
;;   (make-time HOURS MINUTES SECONDS)
;; where SECONDS is a number,
;;       MINUTES is a number, and
;;       HOURS is a number.
(define-struct time (hours minutes seconds))

;; time-&gt;seconds : time -&gt; number
;; computes the number of seconds since midnight for this time

;; EXAMPLES
;; midnight is 0 seconds after midnight
;; 12:00:01 is 1 second after midnight
;; 12:01:00 is 60 seconds after midnight
;;  1:00:00 is 3600 seconds after midnight
;;  2:03:01 is 3782 seconds after midnight

(define (time-&gt;seconds t)
  (+ (time-seconds t)
     (* 60 (time-minutes t))
     (* 60 60 (time-hours t))))

;; EXAMPLES TURNED INTO TESTS

(time-&gt;seconds (make-time 0 0 0)) "should be" 0
(time-&gt;seconds (make-time 0 0 1)) "should be" 1
(time-&gt;seconds (make-time 0 1 0)) "should be" 60
(time-&gt;seconds (make-time 1 0 0)) "should be" 3600
(time-&gt;seconds (make-time 1 3 2)) "should be" 3782
