legal expressions:

1: x is a variable, which is a legal expression
2: Since = is a primitive operation, this expression
   can only be legal if it has an opening parenthesis,
   a closing parenthesis, and some number of expressions
   inside it. The parenthesis are correct and y and z are
   both expressions, so the entire sentence is a legal expression.
3: We know from 2: that (= y z) is a legal expression. Thus, since 0
   is also a legal expression, we know that (= (= y z) 0) contains two
   legal expressions. In order for it to be a legal expression, it
   must also have matching parenthesis and an initial primitive operation,
   which it does.

illegal expressions:
   
1: If a sentence begins with a parenthesis, it must continue
   with either a primitive, a variable or cond. This one does
   none of those things.
2: No expression can begin with a primtive, but this sentence
   does.
3: If an expression begins with a parenthesis and a variable, it must
   have at least one expression after the variable. This one does not.
