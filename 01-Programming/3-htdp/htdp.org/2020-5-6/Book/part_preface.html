Accountants program
 spreadsheets; musicians program synthesizers; authors program word
 processors; and web designers program style sheets.  When we wrote these
 words for the first edition of the book (1995&ndash;2000), readers may have considered
 them futuristic; by now, programming has become a required skill and
 numerous outlets&#8212;<wbr>books, on-line courses, K-12 curricula&#8212;<wbr>cater to this
 need, always with the goal of enhancing people&rsquo;s job prospects.</p><p>The typical course on programming teaches a &ldquo;tinker until it works&rdquo;
 approach. When it works, students exclaim &ldquo;It works!&rdquo; and move on. Sadly,
 this phrase is also the shortest lie in computing, and it has cost many
 people many hours of their lives. In contrast, this book focuses on habits
 of <span class="emph">good programming</span>, addressing both professional and vocational
 programmers.</p><p>By &ldquo;good programming,&rdquo; we mean an approach to the creation of software
 that relies on systematic thought, planning, and understanding from the
 very beginning, at every stage, and for every step.  To emphasize the
 point, we speak of systematic <span class="emph">program design</span> and systematically
 <span class="emph">designed programs</span>.  Critically, the latter articulates the rationale
 of the desired functionality.  Good programming also satisfies an
 aesthetic sense of accomplishment; the elegance of a good program is
 comparable to time-tested poems or the black-and-white photographs of a
 bygone era. In short, programming differs from good programming like
 crayon sketches in a diner from oil paintings in a museum.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">No, this book won&rsquo;t turn anyone into a master painter. But, we would not
 have spent fifteen years writing this edition if we didn&rsquo;t believe that

 universally useful problem-solving skills, experience a deeply creative
 activity, and learn to appreciate a new form of aesthetic. The rest of
 this preface explains in detail what we mean with &#8220;systematic design,&#8221; who
 benefits in what manner, and how we go about teaching it all.</div><h4><a name="(part._sec~3asystematic-design)"></a>Systematic Program Design</h4><p>A program interacts with people, dubbed <span style="font-style: italic">users</span>, and other programs, in
 which case we speak of <span style="font-style: italic">server</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">client</span>
 components. Hence any reasonably complete program consists of many building
 blocks: some deal with input, some create output, while some bridge the gap
 between those two. We choose to use functions as fundamental building
 blocks because everyone encounters functions in pre-algebra and because
 the simplest programs are just such functions.  The key is to discover
 which functions are needed, how to connect them, and how to build them
 from basic ingredients.</p><p>In this context, &ldquo;systematic program design&rdquo; refers to a mix of two
 concepts: design recipes and iterative refinement.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">We drew
inspiration from Michael Jackson&rsquo;s method for creating COBOL programs plus
conversations with Daniel Friedman on recursion, Robert Harper on type
theory, and Daniel Jackson on software design.</span></span></span> The design recipes are a
 creation of the authors, and here they enable the use of the latter.</p><blockquote class="Figure"><blockquote class="Leftfigure"><blockquote class="FigureInside"><ol><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions</span></p><p><span class="Smaller">Identify the information that must be represented and how it is

 functions. This book deals with just two recipes for complete programs:
 one for programs with a graphical user interface (GUI) and one for batch
 programs. In contrast, design recipes for functions come in a wide variety
 of flavors: for atomic forms of data such as numbers; for enumerations of
 different kinds of data; for data that compounds other data in a fixed
 manner; for finite but arbitrarily large data; and so on.</p><p>The function-level design recipes share a common <span style="font-weight: bold">design
process</span>. <a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3athe-design-recipe%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">Figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">1</span></a> displays its six essential
 steps. The title of each step specifies the expected outcome(s); the
 &ldquo;commands&rdquo; suggest the key activities.  Examples play a central role at
 almost every stage.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">Instructors</span> Have students copy
<a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3athe-design-recipe%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">1</span></a> on one side of an index card.  When
students are stuck, ask them to produce their card and point them to the
step where they are stuck.</span></span></span>  For the chosen data representation in step 1,
 writing down examples proves how real-world information is encoded as data
 and how data is interpreted as information. Step 3 says that a
 problem-solver must work through concrete scenarios to gain an
 understanding of what the desired function is expected to compute for
 specific examples. This understanding is exploited in step 5, when it is
 time to define the function. Finally, step 6 demands that examples are
 turned into automated test code, which ensures that the function works
 properly for some cases. Running the function on real-world data may
 reveal other discrepancies between expectations and results.</p><p>Each step of the design process comes with pointed questions.  For certain
 steps&#8212;<wbr>say, the creation of the functional examples or the template&#8212;<wbr>the
 questions may appeal to the data definition. The answers almost
 automatically create an intermediate
 product.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">Instructors</span> The most important questions are
those for steps 4 and 5. Ask students to write down these questions in
their own words on the back of their index card.</span></span></span> This scaffolding pays off
 when it comes time to take the one creative step in the process: the
 completion of the function definition. And even then, help is available in
 almost all cases.</p><p>The novelty of this approach is the creation of intermediate products for
 beginner-level programs. When a novice is stuck, an expert or an
 instructor can inspect the existing intermediate products. The inspection
 is likely to use the generic questions from the design process and thus
 drive the novice to correct himself or herself. And this self-empowering
 process is the key difference between programming and program design.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Iterative Refinement</span> addresses the issue that problems are complex
 and multifaceted. Getting everything right at once is nearly
 impossible. Instead, computer scientists borrow iterative refinement from
 the physical sciences to tackle this design problem. In essence, iterative
 refinement recommends stripping away all inessential details at first and
 finding a solution for the remaining core problem. A refinement step adds
 in one of these omitted details and re-solves the expanded problem, using
 the existing solution as much as possible. A repetition, also called an
 iteration, of these refinement steps eventually leads to a complete
 solution.</p><p>In this sense, a programmer is a miniscientist. Scientists create
 approximate models for some idealized version of the world to make
 predictions about it. As long as the model&rsquo;s predictions come true,
 everything is fine; when the predicted events differ from the actual ones,
 scientists revise their models to reduce the discrepancy. In a similar
 vein, when programmers are given a task, they create a first design, turn
 it into code, evaluate it with actual users, and iteratively refine the
 design until the program&rsquo;s behavior closely matches the desired product.</p><p>This book introduces iterative refinement in two different ways. Since
 designing via refinement becomes useful even when the design of programs becomes
 complex, the book introduces the technique explicitly in the fourth part,
 once the problems acquire a certain degree of difficulty. Furthermore, we
 use iterative refinement to state increasingly complex variants of the
 same problem over the course of the first three parts of the book. That
 is, we pick a core problem, deal with it in one chapter, and then pose a
 similar problem in a subsequent chapter&#8212;<wbr>with details matching the newly
 introduced concepts.</p><h4><a name="(part._drtl)"></a>DrRacket and the Teaching Languages</h4><p>Learning to design programs calls for repeated hands-on practice. Just as
 nobody becomes a piano player without playing the piano, nobody
 becomes a program designer without creating actual programs and getting
 them to work properly. Hence, our book comes with a modicum of software
 support: a language in which to write down programs and a <span style="font-style: italic">program
development environment</span> with which programs are edited like word
 documents and with which readers can run programs.</p><p>Many people we encounter tell us they wish they knew how to code and then
 ask <span class="emph">which programming language</span> they should learn. Given the press
 that some programming languages get, this question is not surprising. But
 it is also wholly inappropriate.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">Instructors</span> For
courses not aimed at beginners, it may be possible to use an off-the-shelf
language with the design recipes.</span></span></span>  Learning to program in a currently
 fashionable programming language often sets up students for
 eventual failure. Fashion in this world is extremely short lived.  A typical
 &ldquo;quick programming in X&rdquo; book or course fails to teach principles that
 transfer to the next fashion language. Worse, the language itself often
 distracts from the acquisition of transferable skills, at the level
 of both expressing solutions and dealing with programming mistakes.</p><p>In contrast, learning to design programs is primarily about the study of
 principles and the acquisition of transferable skills.  The ideal
 programming language must support these two goals, but no off-the-shelf
 industrial language does so. The crucial problem is that beginners make
 mistakes <span class="emph">before</span> they know much of the language, yet programming
 languages always diagnose these errors as if the programmer already knew
 the whole language. As a result, diagnosis reports often stump beginners.</p><p>Our solution is to start with our own tailor-made teaching language,
 dubbed &ldquo;Beginning Student Language&rdquo; or BSL. The language is
 essentially the &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; language that students acquire in pre-algebra
 courses. It includes notation for function definitions, function
 applications, and conditional expressions. Also, expressions can
 be<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">Instructors</span> You may wish to explain that BSL is
pre-algebra with additional forms of data and a host of pre-defined
functions on those.</span></span></span> nested. This language is thus so small that an error
 diagnosis in terms of the whole language is still accessible to readers
 with nothing but pre-algebra under their belt.</p><p>A student who has mastered the structural design principles can then move
 on to &ldquo;Intermediate Student Language&rdquo; and other advanced dialects,
 collectively dubbed <span class="stt">*SL</span>. The book uses these dialects to teach design
 principles of abstraction and general recursion. We firmly believe that
 using such a series of teaching languages provides readers with a superior
 preparation for creating programs for the wide spectrum of
 professional programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, and
 others).</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span> The teaching languages are implemented in <span style="font-style: italic">Racket</span>, a
 programming language we built for building programming languages. Racket
 has escaped from the lab into the real world, and it is a programming
 vehicle of choice in a variety of settings, from gaming to the control of
 telescope arrays. Although the teaching languages borrow elements from the
 Racket language, this book does <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> teach Racket. Then again, a
 student who has completed this book can easily move on to
 Racket. <span style="font-weight: bold">End</span></p><p>When it comes to programming environments, we face an equally bad choice as
 the one for languages. A programming environment for professionals is
 analogous to the cockpit of a jumbo jet. It has numerous controls and
 displays, overwhelming anyone who first launches such a software
 application. Novice programmers need the equivalent of a two-seat,
 single-engine propeller aircraft with which they can practice basic
 skills. We have therefore created DrRacket, a programming environment for
 novices.</p><p>DrRacket supports highly playful, feedback-oriented learning with just two
 simple interactive panes: a definitions area, which contains function
 definitions, and an interactions area, which allows a programmer to ask
 for the evaluation of expressions that may refer to the definitions. In
 this context, it is as easy to explore &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios as in a
 spreadsheet application. Experimentation can start on first contact, using
 conventional calculator-style examples and quickly proceeding to
 calculations with images, words, and other forms of data.</p><p>An interactive program development environment such as DrRacket simplifies the
  learning process in two ways. First, it enables novice programmers to
  manipulate data directly. Because no facilities for reading input
  information from files or devices are needed, novices don&rsquo;t need to spend
  valuable time on figuring out how these work. Second, the arrangement
  strictly separates data and data manipulation from input and output of
  information from the &ldquo;real world.&rdquo; Nowadays this separation is
  considered so fundamental to the systematic design of software that it
  has its own name: <span style="font-style: italic">model-view-controller architecture</span>. By
  working in DrRacket, new programmers are exposed to this fundamental
  software engineering idea in a natural way from the get-go.</p><h4><a name="(part._skills)"></a>Skills that Transfer</h4><p>The skills acquired from learning to design programs systematically
 transfer in two directions. Naturally, they apply to programming in general
 as well as to programming spreadsheets, synthesizers, style sheets, and even word
 processors. Our observations suggest that the design process from
 <a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3athe-design-recipe%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">1</span></a> carries over to almost any programming
 language, and it works for 10-line programs as well as for 10,000-line
 programs. It takes some reflection to adopt the design process across the
 spectrum of languages and scale of programming problems; but once the
 process becomes second nature, its use pays off in many ways.</p><p>Learning to design programs also means acquiring two kinds of universally
 useful skills. Program design certainly teaches the same analytical skills
 as mathematics, especially (pre)algebra and geometry. But, unlike
 mathematics, working with programs is an active approach to
 learning. Creating software provides immediate feedback and thus leads to
 exploration, experimentation, and self-evaluation. The results tend to be
 interactive products, an approach that vastly increases the sense of accomplishment
 when compared to drill exercises in textbooks.</p><p>In addition to enhancing a student&rsquo;s mathematical skills, program design
 teaches analytical reading and writing skills. Even the smallest design
 tasks are formulated as word problems. Without solid reading and comprehension skills, it
 is impossible to design programs that solve a reasonably complex
 problem. Conversely, program design methods force a creator to articulate
 his or her thoughts in proper and precise language. Indeed, if students
 truly absorb the design recipe, they enhance their articulation skills more than
 anything else.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">To illustrate this point, take a second look at the process description in
<a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3athe-design-recipe%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">1</span></a>. It says that a designer must
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ol><li><p>analyze a problem statement, typically stated as a word problem;</p></li><li><p>extract and express its essence, abstractly;</p></li><li><p>illustrate the essence with examples;</p></li><li><p>make outlines and plans based on this analysis;</p></li><li><p>evaluate results with respect to expected outcomes; and</p></li><li><p>revise the product in light of failed checks and tests.</p></li></ol></div><p>Each step requires analysis, precision, description, focus, and attention
 to details.  Any experienced entrepreneur, engineer, journalist,
 lawyer, scientist, or any other professional can explain how many of
 these skills are necessary for his or her daily work. Practicing program
 design&#8212;<wbr>on paper and in DrRacket&#8212;<wbr>is a joyful way to acquire these skills.</p><p>Similarly, refining designs is not restricted to computer science and
 program creation.  Architects, composers, writers, and other professionals
 do it, too.  They start with ideas in their head and somehow articulate
 their essence. They refine these ideas on paper until their product
 reflects their mental image as much as possible. As they bring their ideas
 to paper, they employ skills analogous to fully absorbed design recipes:
 drawing, writing, or piano playing to express certain style elements of a
 building, describe a person&rsquo;s character, or formulate portions of a
 melody. What makes them productive with an iterative development process
 is that they have absorbed their basic design recipes and learned how to
 choose which one to use for the current situation.</p><h4><a name="(part._this)"></a>This Book and Its Parts</h4><p>The purpose of this book is to introduce readers without prior experience
 to the <span class="emph">systematic design of programs</span>.  In tandem, it presents a
 <span class="emph">symbolic view of computation</span>, a method that explains how the
 application of a program to data works. Roughly speaking, this method
 generalizes what students learn in elementary school arithmetic and middle
 school algebra. But have no fear. DrRacket comes with a mechanism&#8212;<wbr>the
 algebraic stepper&#8212;<wbr>that can illustrate these step-by-step calculations.</p><p>The book consists of six parts separated by five intermezzos and is bookended
 by a Prologue and an Epilogue. While the major parts focus on program
 design, the intermezzos introduce supplementary concepts concerning
 programming mechanics and computing.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara"><a href="part_prologue.html" data-pltdoc="x">Prologue: How to Program</a> is a quick introduction to plain programming. It
 explains how to write a simple animation in <span class="stt">*SL</span>. Once finished, any
 beginner is bound to feel simultaneously empowered and overwhelmed. The
 final note therefore explains why plain programming is wrong and how a
 systematic, gradual approach to program design eliminates the sense
 of dread that every beginning programmer usually experiences. Now the
 stage is set for the core of the book:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p><a href="part_one.html" data-pltdoc="x">Fixed-Size Data</a> explains the most fundamental concepts of
systematic design using simple examples. The central idea is that
designers typically have a rough idea of what data the program is supposed
to consume and produce. A systematic approach to design must therefore
extract as many hints as possible from the description of the data that
flows into and out of a program. To keep things simple, this part starts
with atomic data&#8212;<wbr>numbers, images, and so on&#8212;<wbr>and then gradually
introduces new ways of describing data: intervals, enumerations,
itemizations, structures, and combinations of these.</p></li><li><p><a href="i1-2.html" data-pltdoc="x">Intermezzo 1: Beginning Student Language</a> describes the teaching language in complete detail: its
vocabulary, its grammar, and its meaning. Computer scientists refer to these
as syntax and semantics. Program designers use this model of computation
to predict what their creations compute when run or to analyze error
diagnostics.</p></li><li><p><a href="part_two.html" data-pltdoc="x">Arbitrarily Large Data</a> extends <a href="part_one.html" data-pltdoc="x">Fixed-Size Data</a> with the means to
describe the most interesting and useful forms of data: arbitrarily large
compound data. While a programmer may nest the kinds of data from
<a href="part_one.html" data-pltdoc="x">Fixed-Size Data</a> to represent information, the nesting is always of a
fixed depth and breadth. This part shows how a subtle generalization gets
us from there to data of arbitrary size. The focus then switches to the
systematic design of programs that process this kind of data.</p></li><li><p><a href="i2-3.html" data-pltdoc="x">Intermezzo 2: Quote, Unquote</a> introduces a concise and powerful notation for writing
down large pieces of data: quotation and anti-quotation.</p></li><li><p><a href="part_three.html" data-pltdoc="x">Abstraction</a> acknowledges that many of the functions from
<a href="part_two.html" data-pltdoc="x">Arbitrarily Large Data</a> look alike. No programming language should force
programmers to create pieces of code that are so similar to each other.
Conversely, every good programming language comes with ways to eliminate
such similarities. Computer scientists call both the step of eliminating
similarities and its result <span style="font-style: italic">abstraction</span>, and they know that
abstractions greatly increase a programmer&rsquo;s productivity. Hence, this
part introduces design recipes for creating and using abstractions.</p></li><li><p><a href="i3-4.html" data-pltdoc="x">Intermezzo 3: Scope and Abstraction</a> plays two roles. On the one hand, it injects the concept of
<span class="emph">lexical scope</span>, the idea that a programming language ties every
occurrence of a name to a definition that a programmer can find with an
inspection of the code. On the other hand, it explains a library with
additional mechanisms for abstraction, including so-called <span class="emph">for loops</span>.</p></li><li><p><a href="part_four.html" data-pltdoc="x">Intertwined Data</a> generalizes <a href="part_two.html" data-pltdoc="x">Arbitrarily Large Data</a> and explicitly
introduces the idea of iterative refinement into the catalog of design
concepts.</p></li><li><p><a href="i4-5.html" data-pltdoc="x">Intermezzo 4: The Nature of Numbers</a> explains and illustrates why decimal numbers work in
such strange ways in all programming languages. Every budding programmer
ought to know these basic facts.</p></li><li><p><a href="part_five.html" data-pltdoc="x">Generative Recursion</a> adds a new design principle. While
structural design and abstraction suffice for most problems that
programmers encounter, they occasionally lead to insufficiently
&ldquo;performant&rdquo; programs. That is, structurally designed programs
might need too much time or energy to compute the desired
answers. Computer scientists therefore replace structurally designed
programs with programs that benefit from ad hoc insights into the problem
domain. This part of the book shows how to design a large class of just
such programs.</p></li><li><p><a href="i5-6.html" data-pltdoc="x">Intermezzo 5: The Cost of Computation</a> uses examples from <a href="part_five.html" data-pltdoc="x">Generative Recursion</a> to illustrate how
computer scientists think about performance.</p></li><li><p><a href="part_six.html" data-pltdoc="x">Accumulators</a> adds one final trick to the toolbox of designers:
accumulators. Roughly speaking, an accumulator adds &ldquo;memory&rdquo; to a
function.  The addition of memory greatly improves the performance of
structurally designed functions from the first four parts of the book. For
the ad hoc programs from <a href="part_five.html" data-pltdoc="x">Generative Recursion</a>, accumulators can make the
difference between finding an answer and never finding one.</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara"><a href="part_epilogue.html" data-pltdoc="x">Epilogue: Moving On</a> is both an assessment and a look ahead to what&rsquo;s next.</div><blockquote class="Figure"><blockquote class="Centerfigure"><blockquote class="FigureInside"><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><img style="vertical-align: 0px; margin: -3px -3px -3px -3px;" src="pict.png" alt="image" width="534.0" height="534.0"></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="Centertext"><span class="Legend"><span class="FigureTarget"><a name="(counter._(figure._fig~3adependence))" x-target-lift="Figure"></a>Figure&nbsp;2: </span>The dependencies among parts and intermezzos</span></p></blockquote><p>Independent readers ought to work through the entire book, from the first
 page to the last. We say &ldquo;work&rdquo; because we really mean that a reader
 ought to solve all exercises or at least know how to solve them.</p><p>Similarly, instructors ought to cover as many elements as possible,
 starting from the Prologue all the way through the Epilogue.  Our teaching
 experience suggests that this is doable. Typically, we organize our courses
 so that our readers create a sizable and entertaining program over the
 course of the semester. We understand, however, that some circumstances
 call for significant cuts and that some instructors&rsquo; tastes call for
 slightly different ways to use the book.</p><p><a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3adependence%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">Figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">2</span></a> is a navigation chart for those who wish to
 pick and choose from the elements of the book. The figure is a dependency
 graph. A solid arrow from one element to another suggests a mandatory
 ordering; for example, Part II requires an understanding of Part I. In
 contrast, a dotted arrow is mostly a suggestion; for example,
 understanding the Prologue is unnecessary to get through the rest of the
 book.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">Based on this chart, here are three feasible paths through the book:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>A high school instructor may want to cover (as much as possible of)
parts I and II, including a small project such as a game.</p></li><li><p>A college instructor in a quarter system may wish to focus on
<a href="part_one.html" data-pltdoc="x">Fixed-Size Data</a>, <a href="part_two.html" data-pltdoc="x">Arbitrarily Large Data</a>, <a href="part_three.html" data-pltdoc="x">Abstraction</a>,
and <a href="part_five.html" data-pltdoc="x">Generative Recursion</a>, plus the intermezzos on <span class="stt">*SL</span> and scope.</p></li><li><p>A college instructor in a semester system may prefer to discuss
performance trade-offs in designs as early as possible. In this case, it
is best to cover <a href="part_one.html" data-pltdoc="x">Fixed-Size Data</a> and <a href="part_two.html" data-pltdoc="x">Arbitrarily Large Data</a> and then
the accumulator material from <a href="part_six.html" data-pltdoc="x">Accumulators</a> that does not depend
on <a href="part_five.html" data-pltdoc="x">Generative Recursion</a>. At that point, it is possible to discuss
<a href="i5-6.html" data-pltdoc="x">Intermezzo 5: The Cost of Computation</a> and to study the rest of the book from this angle.</p></li></ul></div><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Iteration of Sample Topics</span> The book revisits certain exercise and
 sample topics time and again.  For example, virtual pets are found all over
 <a href="part_one.html" data-pltdoc="x">Fixed-Size Data</a> and even show up in <a href="part_two.html" data-pltdoc="x">Arbitrarily Large Data</a>. Similarly, both
 <a href="part_one.html" data-pltdoc="x">Fixed-Size Data</a> and <a href="part_two.html" data-pltdoc="x">Arbitrarily Large Data</a> cover alternative approaches to
 implementing an interactive text editor. Graphs appear in
 <a href="part_five.html" data-pltdoc="x">Generative Recursion</a> and immediately again in <a href="part_six.html" data-pltdoc="x">Accumulators</a>. The purpose
 of these iterations is to motivate iterative refinement and to introduce
 it through the backdoor. We urge instructors to assign these themed
 sequences of exercises or to create their own such sequences.</p><h4><a name="(part._delta)"></a>The Differences</h4><p><div class="SIntrapara">This second edition of <span style="font-style: italic">How to Design Programs</span> differs from the first
one in several major aspects:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ol><li><p>It explicitly acknowledges the difference between
designing a whole program and the functions that make up a
program. Specifically, this edition focuses on two kinds of programs:
event-driven (mostly GUI, but also networking) programs and batch programs.</p></li><li><p>The design of a program proceeds in a top-down planning phase
followed by a bottom-up construction phase. We explicitly show how the
interface to libraries dictates the shape of certain program elements. In
particular, the very first phase of a program design yields a wish list of
functions. While the concept of a wish list exists in the first edition,
this second edition treats it as an explicit design element.</p></li><li><p>Fulfilling an entry from the wish list relies on the function
design recipe, which is the subject of the six major parts.</p></li><li><p>A key element of structural design is the definition of functions
that compose others. This design-by-composition is especially useful for
the world of batch programs. Like generative recursion,<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">We
thank Kathi Fisler for calling our attention to this point.</span></span></span> it requires a
<span class="emph">eureka!</span>, specifically a recognition that the creation of
intermediate data by one function and processing this intermediate result
by a second function simplifies the overall design. This approach also
needs a wish list, but formulating these wishes calls for an insightful
development of an intermediate data definition. This edition of the book
weaves in a number of explicit exercises on design by composition.</p></li><li><p>While testing has always been a part of our design philosophy, the
teaching languages and DrRacket started supporting it properly only in 2002,
just after we had released the first edition. This new edition heavily
relies on this testing support.</p></li><li><p>This edition of the book drops the design of imperative programs. The
old chapters remain available on-line. An adaptation of this material will
appear in the second volume of this series, <span style="font-style: italic">How to Design Components.</span></p></li><li><p>The book&rsquo;s examples and exercises employ new teachpacks. The
preferred style is to link in these libraries via
<span class="RktSym"><a href="../../htdp-langs/beginner.html#%28form._%28%28lib._lang%2Fhtdp-beginner..rkt%29._require%29%29" class="RktStxLink" data-pltdoc="x">require</a></span>, but it is still possible to add
teachpacks via a menu in DrRacket.</p></li><li><p><div class="SIntrapara">Finally, this second edition differs from the first in a few aspects
 of terminology and notation:

co-developed a predecessor of Rice University&rsquo;s introductory course with the first
author; Daniel P. Friedman, for asking the first author to rewrite
<span class="emph">The Little LISPer</span> (also MIT Press) in 1984, because it started this
project; John Clements, who designed, implemented, and maintains DrRacket&rsquo;s
stepper; and Paul Steckler, who faithfully supported the team with
contributions to our suite of programming tools.</p><p>The development of the book benefited from many other friends and
colleagues who used it in courses and/or gave detailed comments on
early drafts. We are grateful to them for their help and patience:
Ian Barland,
John Clements,
Bruce Duba,
Mike Ernst,
Kathi Fisler,
Daniel P. Friedman,
John Greiner,
G&#233;raldine Morin,
John Stone,
and
Valdemar Tamez.</p><p>A dozen generations of Comp 210 students at Rice used
early drafts of the text and contributed improvements in various
ways.  In addition, numerous attendees of our TeachScheme! workshops used early
drafts in their classrooms. Many sent in comments and
suggestions. As representative of these we mention the following active
contributors:
Ms. Barbara Adler,
Dr. Stephen Bloch,
Ms. Karen Buras,
Mr. Jack Clay,
Dr. Richard Clemens,
Mr. Kyle Gillette,
Mr. Marvin Hernandez,
Mr. Michael Hunt,
Ms. Karen North,
Mr. Jamie Raymond,
and
Mr. Robert Reid.
Christopher Felleisen patiently worked through the first few parts of
the book with his father and provided direct insight into the views of a
young student.
Hrvoje Blazevic (sailing, at the time, as Master of the <span style="font-style: italic">LPG/C Harriette</span>),
Joe Zachary (University of
Utah), and Daniel P. Friedman (Indiana University) discovered numerous
typos in the first printing, which we have now fixed.
Thank you to everyone.</p><p>Finally, Matthias expresses his gratitude to Helga for her many years of
patience and for creating a home for an absent-minded husband and
father. Robby is grateful to Hsing-Huei Huang for her support and
encouragement; without her, he would not have gotten anything
done. Matthew thanks Wen Yuan for her constant support and enduring music.
Shriram is indebted to Kathi Fisler for support, patience and puns, and for
her participation in this project.</p><h3><a name="(part._.Acknowledgments)"></a>Acknowledgments</h3><p>As in 2001, we are grateful to John Clements for designing, validating,
implementing, and maintaining DrRacket&rsquo;s algebraic stepper. He has done so for
nearly 20 years now, and the stepper has become an indispensable tool of
explanation and instruction.</p><p>Over the past few years, several colleagues have commented on the various
drafts and suggested improvements. We gratefully acknowledge the thoughtful
conversations and exchanges with these individuals:</p><p><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote><p>Kathi Fisler (WPI and Brown University), Gregor Kiczales (University of
British Columbia), Prabhakar Ragde (University of Waterloo), and Norman
Ramsey (Tufts University).</p></blockquote></div><div class="SIntrapara">Thousands of teachers and instructors attended our various workshops over
the years, and many provided valuable feedback. But Dan Anderson, Stephen
Bloch, Jack Clay, Nadeem Abdul Hamid, and Viera Proulx stand out, and we
wish to call out their role in the crafting of this edition.</div><p>Guillaume Marceau, working with Kathi Fisler and Shriram, spent many months
studying and improving the error messages in DrRacket. We are grateful for his
amazing work.</p><p>Celeste Hollenbeck is the most amazing reader ever. She never tired of
pushing back until she understood the prose. She never stopped until a
section supported its thesis, its organization matched, and its sentences
connected. Thank you very much for your incredible efforts.</p><p>We also thank the following: Ennas Abdussalam,  Mark Aldrich,  Mehmet Akif Akkus,  Anisa Anuar,  Franco Barbeite,
